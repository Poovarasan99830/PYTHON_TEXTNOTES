# Overview:

Concurrency ──► Multithreading ──► Shares memory, GIL limits CPU-bound performance
             └─► Asyncio ──► Single thread, non-blocking I/O

Parallelism ──► Multiprocessing ──► Multiple processes, true parallel execution, bypasses GIL



# ___________________________________________________________________
## **1. Concurrency vs Parallelism**

                                                                                                  
| **Concurrency** | 

Managing multiple tasks at the same time, but **not necessarily executing them at the exact same moment**.
It’s about switching between tasks efficiently. 



#Example:
A single cashier at a grocery store handles multiple customers by switching between scanning, bagging, and answering questions. 
# ___________________________________________________________________


one class room --python ,java,dot net
multiple class room-->python,java,dot net


# ___________________________________________________________________


Manager--one person
Cooking --one stove
Downloading --one browser
Chatgpt --one gpt

# ___________________________________________________________________



| **Parallelism** | 

Executing multiple tasks at **exactly the same time** on multiple CPU cores or processors.                                                                 

#Example:
 Two cashiers serving two customers at the same time in different checkout lines.     
 


 shop...hall
 billing counter                                           |

small shop

meadium shop 

big shop



**Key Difference**:

* Concurrency → *Dealing with* multiple things at once (can be single-core).
* Parallelism → *Doing* multiple things at once (requires multi-core).

## **2. Multithreading in Python**

### What is Multithreading?

* Running multiple **threads** (lightweight units of a process) in the same memory space.
* Useful for **I/O-bound tasks** (waiting for files, network, database).
* **Not great for CPU-bound tasks** in Python because of the GIL.

---

### **Worker Process vs Thread**

* **Thread** → Lightweight, shares memory with other threads in the same process.
* **Worker Process** → Heavyweight, has its own memory space, runs independently (used in multiprocessing).

---

### **GIL (Global Interpreter Lock)**

* Python (CPython) has a **mutex** called the GIL that ensures only **one thread executes Python bytecode at a time**.
* Even on a multi-core CPU, threads cannot run Python code truly in parallel.
* Good for avoiding race conditions, but bad for CPU-heavy computations.




**Example**:

```python
import threading

def task():
    for i in range(5):
        print(f"Task running: {i}")

thread1 = threading.Thread(target=task)
thread2 = threading.Thread(target=task)

thread1.start()
thread2.start()

thread1.join()
thread2.join()  # Wait for thread to complete
```



Why we use join()?
     Normally, threads run independently (parallel).
     But sometimes, we need:
     Main program should wait for thread result
     Ensure tasks happen in correct order
     Avoid incomplete execution

➡ Threads will interleave execution, but **not run CPU-heavy code in parallel** due to the GIL.

---___________________________________________________________________________________

### **Threading Module**

* Python's `threading` library allows:

  * Creating and managing threads
  * Synchronization (`Lock`, `Semaphore`)
  * Thread-safe communication (`queue.Queue`)

Example with Lock:

```python
import threading

lock = threading.Lock()
count = 0

def increment():
    global count
    for _ in range(1000):
        with lock:
            count += 1

threads = [threading.Thread(target=increment) for _ in range(5)]

for t in threads: t.start()
for t in threads: t.join()

print(count)  # Always 5000 due to lock
```






---___________________________________________________________________________________

## **3. Multiprocessing in Python**

* Uses **separate processes** instead of threads.
* **Bypasses the GIL** because each process has its own Python interpreter and memory.
* Ideal for **CPU-bound tasks** (math-heavy computations, image processing).

Example:

```python
from multiprocessing import Process, Value

def increment(counter):
    for _ in range(1000):
        with counter.get_lock():
            counter.value += 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    counter = Value('i', 0)
    processes = [Process(target=increment, args=(counter,)) for _ in range(5)]

    for p in processes: p.start()
    for p in processes: p.join()

    print(counter.value)  # 5000
```

---___________________________________________________________________________________

## **4. Asynchronous Programming**

### Key Idea

* Runs **tasks concurrently** in a single thread using an **event loop**.
* **Non-blocking I/O** — the program doesn’t wait for slow operations; it continues running other tasks.
* Uses **coroutines**.

---

### **Asyncio Library**

* Python's built-in library for asynchronous programming.
* Manages an event loop that schedules and runs coroutines.

---

### **Coroutine**

* Special function that can pause and resume execution.
* Defined with `async def`.
* You use `await` to pause until an async operation finishes.

Example:

```python
import asyncio

async def greet():
    print("Hello")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print("World")

async def main():
    await asyncio.gather(greet(), greet(), greet())

asyncio.run(main())
```

➡ Outputs "Hello" three times immediately, then "World" three times after 1 second — running concurrently in one thread.

---

### **async / await**

* `async def` → defines a coroutine.
* `await` → pauses coroutine until the awaited task completes.
* `asyncio.gather()` → runs multiple coroutines concurrently.

---

## **5. When to Use What**

| Task Type                                            | Best Approach                     | Why                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **I/O-bound** (network, file read/write, DB queries) | Multithreading or Asyncio         | I/O waits a lot → Threads or event loop keep CPU busy.    |
| **CPU-bound** (math, data processing, compression)   | Multiprocessing                   | Bypasses GIL and uses multiple cores.                     |
| **Mixed workload**                                   | Combine multiprocessing + asyncio | Processes for CPU-heavy work, asyncio for I/O-heavy work. |

Process = House
Threads = People inside the house working on tasks
Memory = All rooms shared by people inside the same house

A process is:

Private memory
Resources (files, network, etc.)
Metadata managed by OS



A thread is:

A sequence of instructions the CPU executes
Has its own registers and call-stack
Lives inside a process



The OS creates a process to provide a safe sandbox:

✔ Safe memory boundaries
✔ Controlled access to hardware
✔ Fair CPU scheduling
✔ Crash isolation



🔽 Layer 7 — Real-World Analogy (super easy!)
Process = Restaurant

Has its own building (memory)
Has its own kitchen tools, fridge (resources)
Has a supervisor (OS)

Main Thread = First chef
When the restaurant opens, the first chef starts working.
Additional Threads = More chefs

You can hire more chefs to work on tasks concurrently.
But all chefs work inside the same restaurant, sharing:

Ingredients (memory)
Kitchen tools (resources)



A process is a running instance of a program that has its own memory, resources, and at least one thread of execution.

The thread is the actual entity that the CPU runs.
A process is the container; a thread is the worker.




Hardware
    ↓
CPU executes only one instruction stream per core
    ↓
OS schedules threads using time slicing
    ↓
Process = memory + resources + threads
    ↓
Threads = actual workers the CPU runs
    ↓
Python interpreter runs inside a thread
    ↓
The GIL allows only one Python thread to run bytecode at a time
    ↓
I/O releases the GIL → thread switching → concurrency









Hardware
  → CPU runs one thread per core

OS
  → Creates processes
  → Schedules threads
  → Performs context switching

Process
  → Memory (heap + stacks)
  → Resources (files, sockets)

Thread
  → Execution unit inside process
  → Own stack, shared heap

Python Interpreter (inside thread)
  → Runs bytecode in eval loop
  → Protected by GIL
  → I/O releases GIL → concurrency

Concurrency Issues
  → Race conditions
  → Deadlocks
  → Poor CPU scaling due to GIL

Real System Example (Chrome)
  → Many processes
  → Many threads per process
  → Isolation + concurrency





+---------------------------------------------+
| Process (PID 1234)                           |
|  +---------------------------------------+   |
|  | Thread A (main)  - stack A            |   |
|  | Thread B         - stack B            |   |
|  | Thread C         - stack C            |   |
|  |  shared heap: objects, lists, dicts  |   |
|  +---------------------------------------+   |
+---------------------------------------------+


When you run a program (like python myapp.py), the OS creates a process.

A Process = A running instance of a program

It has:

Its own memory space (address space)

Its own resources (file handles, sockets)

At least one thread — the main thread



Process Memory
--------------------------------
| Code (instructions)          |
| Global variables             |
| Heap (dynamic memory)        |
| Thread 1 stack               |
| Thread 2 stack               |
| Thread 3 stack               |
--------------------------------

Why this structure?

Code: CPU must read instructions

Globals: used by whole program

Heap: shared objects created at runtime

Stacks: each thread needs call history, local variables



Simple-aa: Process = Oru independent house.



🧩 All threads share the same heap

Heap = house fridge, TV maadhri — everyone can use.

Stack = personal cupboard — only that person use pannalam.





Okay, super simple **Tanglish** explanation of:

# ⭐ **Thread vs Function vs Variables (FIRST PRINCIPLES + Tanglish)**

Let’s rebuild the concept from ZERO.

---

# 🧠 **1. Function-na enna?**

**Function = Oru task perform panna instructions set.**

Example:

```
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

### Tanglish Meaning:

* Function is like **oru recipe**.
* Kadai-la sambar seyyanum → recipe instructions.
* Program-la task seyyanum → function instructions.

### Important:

* Function **does NOT run automatically**.
* Function **runs only when you call it**.

---

# 🧵 **2. Thread-na enna?**

**Thread = Program-la nadakkara actual “execution flow”.**

### Tanglish Meaning:

* Thread is a **worker**.
* Function is the **work**.
* Thread is the **worker doing the work**.

Example:

```
Thread A:
    calls function1()
Thread B:
    calls function2()
```

One program (process) can have **multiple threads** doing **multiple functions** at the same time.

---

# 📦 **3. Variables-na enna?**

**Variable = Memory-la store panna oru value-kku oru name.**

Example:

```
x = 10
name = "Poovarasan"
```

### Tanglish Meaning:

* Variable = Oru dabba.
* Andha dabba-la data store pannirukkom.
* Code flow (thread) use pannum.

---

# 🔥 **FIRST PRINCIPLES MAIN POINT — Relation Between All Three**

## ✔ **Thread executes Functions**

Thread is the **runner**.
Function is the **instructions**.

```
Thread → runs → Function
```

Example:

```
Thread:
    execute print_hello() function
```

## ✔ **Function uses Variables**

Function-ku information venum → variables provide pannum.

```
Function → uses → Variables
```

Example:

```
def add(a, b):
    return a + b  # a and b are variables
```

## ✔ **Variables live in memory**

2 types:

### 1. **Local variables → Function stack**

* Each thread has its **own stack**
* Local variables are **NOT shared**

Example:

```
Thread A: x = 10
Thread B: x = 20  (different x)
```

### 2. **Global variables → Heap / global area**

* All threads **share** this
* Race condition possible

# 🧵 + 🍳 + 📦 **One Super Simple Analogy**

### 🏠 House = Process

### 👩‍🍳 Cook = Thread

### 📝 Recipe = Function

### 🥕 Carrot, Salt = Variables

* Recipe tells what steps to do → function
* Cook follows recipe → thread
* Ingredients store pannirukkura containers → variables
* Same house-la irukkura cooks (threads)
  can share some ingredients (global variables).

Here are **super clear + simple + practical** code examples to show:

### ✅ When thread object is created

# 🔥 **Example 1 — Thread object create aanaalum, start aagathu**

```python
import threading

def task():
    print("Task ku vandhachu")

# only object create
t = threading.Thread(target=task)

print("Thread object created...")
```

### 👉 Tanglish Explanation

* Ippo `t` nu oru thread **object** ready.
* **But CPU la run aagala.**

### Output:

```
Thread object created...
```

---

# 🔥 **Example 2 — Thread.start() panni thread run pannudhu**

```python
import threading

def task():
    print("Child thread running...")

t = threading.Thread(target=task)  
t.start()

print("Main thread continues...")
```

### 👉 Tanglish Explanation

* `.start()` pottadhum python **new thread create pannum**
* Andha thread `task()` execute pannum
* Main thread separate-aa continue aagum

### Output (order may vary):

```
Child thread running...
Main thread continues...
```

Threads → unpredictable order.

---

# 🔥 **Example 3 — Proving main thread + child thread run parallel**

```python
import threading
import time

def child():
    for i in range(5):
        print("Child thread:", i)
        time.sleep(0.5)

print("Main thread started")

t = threading.Thread(target=child)
t.start()

for i in range(5):
    print("Main thread:", i)
    time.sleep(0.5)

print("Main thread finished")
```

### 👉 Tanglish Explanation

* Main thread 5 print pannum
* Child thread 5 print pannum
* Rendu **interleaving** (mix) aagum.

### Sample Output:

```
Main thread: 0
Child thread: 0
Main thread: 1
Child thread: 1
Main thread: 2
Child thread: 2
...
```

This shows **true multithreading (concurrency)**.

# 🔥 **Example 4 — 5 threads start at once (Flipkart/Zomato simulation)**

```python
import threading
import time

def fetch_item(item_id):
    print(f"Fetching item {item_id} from server...")
    time.sleep(1)
    print(f"Completed: item {item_id}")

threads = []

for i in range(1, 6):
    t = threading.Thread(target=fetch_item, args=(i,))
    t.start()
    threads.append(t)

# Wait for all threads to finish
for t in threads:
    t.join()

print("All items fetched")
```

### 👉 Tanglish Explanation

Zomato / Flipkart la:

* Item 1 → thread
* Item 2 → thread
* Item 3 → thread
* item data parallel-aa fetch aagum

Result: UI fast 🤩

# 🔥 Want more?

I can give:

✅ Zomato order → internal threads
✅ Flipkart search → thread pool diagram
✅ CPU vs I/O threading difference
✅ ThreadPoolExecutor examples

Just tell me: **“give Zomato thread architecture”** or **“give ThreadPoolExecutor example”**.





Here is the **clearest Flipkart example** showing:

# 🛒 **Flipkart Search — Normal (NO THREADS) vs Threaded**

When you search for **"mobile"** on Flipkart:

Flipkart needs to fetch data from:

1. **Product service**
2. **Price service**
3. **Rating service**
4. **Review service**
5. **Image service**

If NO threads → everything waits → slow
If threads → all fetch parallel → SUPER FAST 🔥

---

# 🟥 **1. NORMAL (NO THREADS) — Flipkart search is slow**

All services are called **one-by-one**.

```python
import time

def fetch_service(name, delay):
    print(f"Fetching {name}...")
    time.sleep(delay)   # simulating API delay
    print(f"Completed {name}")

start = time.time()

fetch_service("Product Data", 2)
fetch_service("Price Details", 2)
fetch_service("Ratings", 2)
fetch_service("Reviews", 2)
fetch_service("Images", 2)

end = time.time()
print("Total time:", end - start)
```

### 🧠 Output (Serial order)

```
Fetching Product Data...
Completed Product Data
Fetching Price Details...
Completed Price Details
Fetching Ratings...
Completed Ratings
Fetching Reviews...
Completed Reviews
Fetching Images...
Completed Images
Total time: ~10 seconds
```

➡️ 5 tasks × 2 sec = **10 seconds**
➡️ Flipkart would feel **very slow**.

---

# 🟩 **2. WITH THREADS — Flipkart becomes FAST**

All services fetched **parallel-aa**.

```python
import threading
import time

def fetch_service(name, delay):
    print(f"Fetching {name}...")
    time.sleep(delay)
    print(f"Completed {name}")

start = time.time()

services = [
    ("Product Data", 2),
    ("Price Details", 2),
    ("Ratings", 2),
    ("Reviews", 2),
    ("Images", 2)
]

threads = []

for name, d in services:
    t = threading.Thread(target=fetch_service, args=(name, d))
    t.start()
    threads.append(t)

for t in threads:
    t.join()

end = time.time()
print("Total time:", end - start)
```

### 🧠 Output (Mixed order)

```
Fetching Product Data...
Fetching Price Details...
Fetching Ratings...
Fetching Reviews...
Fetching Images...
Completed Product Data
Completed Price Details
Completed Ratings
Completed Reviews
Completed Images
Total time: ~2 seconds
```

➡️ All services respond at same time
➡️ Total time = **2 seconds**, NOT 10 seconds
➡️ Flipkart search becomes **very fast**

# 🧠 Tanglish Explanation

### 🔥 Normal (NO thread)

* product API → wait
* price API → wait
* rating API → wait
* review API → wait
* image API → wait
* 10 seconds aagum
* UI slow, customer angry 😡

### 🔥 Multi-threading (Parallel)

* product + price + rating + review + image
  **all start at same time**
* Wait 2 seconds only
* UI = super fast ⚡
* Customer happy 😍

 GIL does NOT protect shared data from race conditions.
 **Lock**: prevents **race conditions on shared resources**.


 # ✅ 2. **Why Python has GIL?**

* Makes **memory management simpler**.
* Prevents **race conditions** (when multiple threads modify data simultaneously).
* Python objects (like lists, dictionaries) become **thread-safe** without extra locks.

**Analogy:**

> If two students write in the same notebook at the same time, content may get mixed up.

> GIL ensures that **one student finishes writing before the next one starts**.




### ✅ **Default Thread Safety in Python**

* Python’s **GIL** makes **simple operations thread-safe**.
* By default, **race conditions are rare** for small operations.
* **However**, for **complex operations or multiple-step processes**, race conditions **can still occur**, and using **locks is necessary**.




### ✅ **Threads vs Multiprocessing**

* **Threads** → Shared memory → Race condition **possible** → Need **locks**.
* **Multiprocessing** → Separate memory → **No race condition by default**.
* Only when using **shared objects in multiprocessing** (like `Value`, `Array`, or `Manager`) do you need **locks** to avoid race conditions.




Race condition apadina, **two or more threads simultaneously same data modify pannumbothu problem varuthu**.
Result unpredictable-a irukkum — sometimes correct, sometimes wrong.
Python la GIL & locks use pannina, race condition avoid panna mudiyum.

Python la **GIL simple operations-ku thread-safe**, default-a **race condition rare-a varum**.
> But **complex operations / multiple steps** la **race condition varum**, adhukku **Locks use panrathu necessary**.

Threads → shared memory → race condition possible → need **locks**.
> Multiprocessing → separate memory → **no race condition by default**.
> Only when using **shared objects in multiprocessing**, **Locks are needed**.






### **I/O-bound threads and the GIL**

1. **GIL normally:**

   * Python allows **only one thread to run Python code at a time** because of the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).
   * This blocks multiple threads from running CPU-bound tasks simultaneously.

2. **I/O operations:**

   * I/O tasks like `time.sleep()`, file read/write, or network calls **don’t need the CPU** while waiting.
   * Python **automatically releases the GIL** when a thread is waiting for I/O.

3. **Effect:**

   * While one thread is waiting (sleeping or reading a file), **another thread can acquire the GIL and run Python code**.
   * This allows multiple I/O-bound threads to run **concurrently**, even in Python with GIL.

---

### **Analogy**

* Imagine a single cashier (GIL) in a shop.
* CPU-bound tasks → customer needs help immediately → cashier busy → others wait.
* I/O-bound tasks → customer waits for delivery (sleep/network) → cashier is free → next customer can be served.

---

So, **the key point:**

> Python **releases the GIL automatically during I/O waits**, letting other threads run. This is why threading helps I/O-bound tasks.

If you want, I can make a **tiny timing diagram showing GIL release during I/O**—it will make it very clear visually.





# _______________________________________________________________________


1️⃣ GIL vs threading.Lock()

         GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) only prevents multiple Python bytecodes from executing at the exact same time in CPython.

         GIL does NOT protect shared data from race conditions.

         Example: Two threads updating a shared list or variable simultaneously.

         Even with GIL, operations that are not atomic (like x += 1) can get interrupted between bytecodes.

         threading.Lock() is a manual way to protect critical sections.

         Ensures that only one thread at a time can execute that block of code.


al Interpreter Lock

* Python (CPython) ல் ஒரு **single lock** இருக்குது called **GIL**.
* GIL ஒரு நேரத்தில் **one thread மட்டும் Python bytecode execute பண்ணுறதுக்கு** allow பண்ணும்.
* அதனால multi-threading-ல் **CPU-bound tasks** (heavy calculations, loops, math operations) **parallel-ஆ run ஆகல**.

---

### 🟢 Example:

```python
import threading, time

def cpu_task(n):
    x = 0
    for i in range(10_000_000):
        x += i
    print(f"Done {n}")

threads = [threading.Thread(target=cpu_task, args=(i,)) for i in range(4)]
start = time.time()
for t in threads: t.start()
for t in threads: t.join()
print(time.time() - start)
```

* Even 4 threads, **execution time ≈ single thread**.
* GIL block பண்ணுது, because Python bytecode **only one thread at a time** execute பண்ணலாம்.

---

### 🟢 But I/O-bound tasks (file/network/sleep)

```python
import threading, time

def io_task(n):
    time.sleep(2)
    print(f"Done {n}")

threads = [threading.Thread(target=io_task, args=(i,)) for i in range(4)]
start = time.time()
for t in threads: t.start()
for t in threads: t.join()
print(time.time() - start)
```

* Here **threads mostly waiting** (`sleep` or network).
* GIL free ஆகுது **waiting time 동안** → next thread run ஆகுது.
* Total time much less than sequential.

---

### 🟢 Summary (Thunglish)

| Task Type | GIL Effect               | Result with Threading            |
| --------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| CPU-bound | Threads block each other | No real speedup (parallel fails) |
| I/O-bound | GIL released during wait | Speedup ✅, tasks overlap         |

---

### 🔹 Simple analogy:

* CPU-bound → One person writing numbers on paper, even if 4 people available, GIL says **only one pen at a time** → slow.
* I/O-bound → People mostly waiting for paper/ink → others can write meanwhile → faster.
