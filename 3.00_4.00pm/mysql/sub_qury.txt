#1. What is a Subquery?



>A subquery is always enclosed in parentheses `( )`



#__________________________________________________________________

# 2. Why Use Subqueries?

* To **filter** results based on a computed set.
* To perform **comparisons** against results from another table.
* To **return aggregated** data for another query.
* To make **dynamic filters** using inner results.



#__________________________________________________________________

#3. Types of Subqueries (Based on Usage)

| Type                      | Description                          | Example Syntax                                                           |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Single-row subquery**   | Returns **one value**                | `WHERE price > (SELECT AVG(price) FROM products)`                        |
| **Multiple-row subquery** | Returns **a list of values**         | `WHERE category_id IN (SELECT id FROM categories)`                       |
| 







#__________________________________________________________________

# 4. Subqueries Can Be Used In...

| Clause              | Description                       | Example                                                                 |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SELECT`            | Compute values dynamically        | `SELECT name, (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM emp) AS avg_sal FROM emp`        |
| `FROM`              | Treat subquery as a derived table | `SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM emp WHERE salary > 5000) AS temp`         |
| `WHERE` / `HAVING`  | Filter data conditionally         | `WHERE dept_id IN (SELECT id FROM dept WHERE location = 'NY')`          |
| `UPDATE` / `DELETE` | Apply conditions dynamically      | `DELETE FROM emp WHERE dept_id = (SELECT id FROM dept WHERE name='HR')` |

#5. Subquery vs Join – Comparison

| Feature     | Subquery                            | JOIN                               |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Simplicity  | Easier for single-value comparisons | Better for multi-table combination |
| Performance | Slower for large datasets           | Faster due to optimized joins      |
| Readability | Easier in nested logic              | Easier when combining datasets     |




#__________________________________________________________________



 

Main Query
   |
   --> Subquery (inner, in WHERE or FROM)

EG:



SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (
    SELECT AVG(salary)
    FROM employees
);



#__________________________________________________________________

#7. Practice Queries (With Sales Table or Your Own Schema)






##Single-Row Subquery

SELECT * FROM sales
WHERE price > (SELECT AVG(price) FROM sales);




# Multi-Row Subquery with IN

SELECT * FROM sales
WHERE region IN (
  SELECT region FROM sales WHERE quantity > 8
);






# Correlated Subquery


SELECT product, price
FROM sales s1
WHERE price > (
    SELECT AVG(price)
    FROM sales s2
    WHERE s1.category = s2.category
);


#Subquery in FROM Clause


SELECT category, total_qty
FROM (
  SELECT category, SUM(quantity) AS total_qty
  FROM sales
  GROUP BY category
) AS sub
WHERE total_qty > 15;



#__________________________________________________________________




# Step-by-Step Approach

1. **Start with the outer query alone**
2. Add **basic subquery** in `WHERE` clause
3. Show subquery in **SELECT** clause
4. Introduce **correlated subqueries**
5. Transition to **nested subqueries**
6. Compare with **JOINs**
7. Use **real-world scenarios**

# 9. Common Mistakes Students Make

| Mistake                                   | Solution                                            |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Forgetting parentheses `()`               | Always wrap subqueries in parentheses               |
| Expecting a single value but getting many | Use `IN` or `ANY`, not `=`                          |
| Not aliasing a derived table              | Always give subqueries in `FROM` clause an alias    |
| Misunderstanding correlated logic         | Trace execution row by row, or use EXPLAIN for help |



#__________________________________________________________________

##10. Use Case Examples for Subqueries

| Scenario                                    | Subquery Example                                       |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Highest priced product                      | `WHERE price = (SELECT MAX(price) FROM sales)`         |
| Customers who bought more than avg quantity | `WHERE quantity > (SELECT AVG(quantity) FROM sales)`   |
| Categories with total quantity > 20         | Subquery with `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` in `FROM` clause |



#__________________________________________________________________

# 11. Assignments & Challenges

# Level 1 (Basic)

* Find products with price above average.
* List sales from regions where quantity > 5.

### Level 2 (Intermediate)

* Show customers who bought more than any single customer in 'West'.
* Use a subquery to find the top 3 products by quantity.

### Level 3 (Advanced)

* Use a correlated subquery to find the most expensive product per category.
* Subquery in `FROM` to get sales summary and filter the result.




#__________________________________________________________________


#12. Tools to Use While Teaching

* **MySQL Workbench / phpMyAdmin**: to run queries live
* **DrawSQL or dbdiagram.io**: to visualize schemas
* **EXPLAIN keyword**: to show query execution
* **Slide/PDF**: with patterns: WHERE, SELECT, FROM, HAVING subqueries

| Keyword  | Purpose                         | Returns true if...                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `EXISTS` | Checks if subquery returns rows | At least one row exists in subquery          |
| `ANY`    | Compare with any one value      | Condition is true for **at least one** value |
| `ALL`    | Compare with every value        | Condition is true for **all values**         |

SELECT count(product), price, product 
FROM sales 
WHERE price > 28.43 
GROUP BY product;
product is in the GROUP BY, ✅

price is not aggregated and not in GROUP BY, ❌

_____________________________________________________________________

 Add all non-aggregated columns to GROUP BY
SELECT COUNT(product), price, product
FROM sales
WHERE price > 28.43
GROUP BY product, price;

This works if each product can have different prices (e.g., different rows for the same product name with different prices).



**Multiple-column**       | Returns **more than one column**     | `SELECT * FROM ... WHERE (a, b) IN (SELECT x, y FROM ...)`               |
| **Correlated subquery**   | Uses data from the **outer query**   | `WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM emp WHERE dept_id = e.dept_id)` |
| **Nested subquery**       | Subquery **inside another subquery** | `SELECT * FROM ... WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM (SELECT ...))`            |
