Got it üëç The error

```
failed to read dockerfile: open Dockerfile: no such file or directory
```

means Docker can‚Äôt find a file named **`Dockerfile`** in the folder:

```
D:\PYTHON FULL STACK DEVELOPMENT\DJANGO_FLASK_CLASS\frmawork3\Docker
```

---

‚úÖ **Fix: Create a `Dockerfile` in that folder.**

Steps:

1. Go to the folder:

   ```powershell
   cd "D:\PYTHON FULL STACK DEVELOPMENT\DJANGO_FLASK_CLASS\frmawork3\Docker"
   ```

2. Create a file named **`Dockerfile`** (no extension, capital D is important).
   Example content:

   ```dockerfile
   FROM alpine:latest
   CMD ["echo", "hello docker"]
   ```

3. Build again:

   ```powershell
   docker build -t my-simple-image .
   ```

4. Run the image:

   ```powershell
   docker run --rm my-simple-image
   ```

You should see:

```
hello docker
```

üëâ Do you want me to give you a **ready-made PowerShell command** to create the Dockerfile automatically so you don‚Äôt have to open an editor?
